# How To Get Support

You can best reach us on our Discord server. You can also send an email to support@dcc-ex.com or use the form at using the "get support" link to the left". We try to follow FaceBook and JMRI groups, but there are just too many separate groups to see and respond to all the message. Thank you for your support!
