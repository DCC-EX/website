# Motor boards

There are many motor boards available to use with DCC++ EX. Also called "Dual-H Bridges" and "Motor Shields", some require a little work, but others are mostly plug and play.

NOTE: We recommend the Arduino Motor Shield R3 or a supported clone board like the Deek-Robot ($15 US).

There are other boards, some requiring modification, which are covered in the advanced section.
