# The DCC++ EX Project

Who is behind all this? And will they ever face justice? Who knows, but the following is a list of those names associated with taking over the DCC++ Base Station Project and advancing it into the future. 

First, a special thanks to Gregg E. Berman who had the original idea for a model railroad Base Station using an Arduino Uno and a Motor Shield. If you want to read a short history of the project and what's changed over the years, click HERE (TODO - Create a link for this)

What you see available for download here represents a complete rewrite of the code and the concept of what we (and what you tell us) DCC++ EX needs to be. You can seek us out here:
